# cmake_c_unittest_comparison
Comparison of C language unit testing frameworks with CMake (CUnit, Unity, cmocka etc)

### Purpose

I'm on the search for a simple unit testing framework for pure C. Some frameworks are more popular and are mentioned in many forum discussions, such as Unity / Ceedling, CUnit, cmocka, but there are plenty other less known ones that could be just as good. C++ frameworks are excluded (google test, boost test, cppunit and alike) even if they're supposed to work well with C. I don't want to bother with mixed code.

As I explore different options, I check a few points about them, such as how actively they're maintained, number of maintainers, how easy they're to integrate into a simple CMake / CTest project, how informative the output is and so on. I'm not going to waste a lot of time on each framewok - it's going to be mostly first-impressions level, so don't expect deep insights. First I need to reduce the list to a few best options, that's what these notes are for.

### Progress

This is obviously a work in progress.

* Frameworks I've tried:

  this list is going to grow
